# Car_price_predictor
 
I recently completed a project focused on building a car price predictor. First, I performed preprocessing by removing non-numerical values from numerical features and eliminating unwanted characters. I also removed null values and extracted the first three words of each row in the name feature. Additionally, I removed outliers and conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain better insights into the dataset.

To handle categorical features, I applied one-hot encoding and then deployed various models to predict car prices. I utilized ColumnTransformer and Pipeline to streamline the preprocessing and model training process. After evaluating multiple models, I selected the Random Forest Regressor as the best-performing model.

For building the user interface, I used Flask within PyCharm, which provided an interactive and user-friendly way to input car details and obtain price predictions.
